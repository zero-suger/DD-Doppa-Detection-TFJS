[DD] Doppa-Detection : DOPPA (traditional square hat worn by Uyghurs, Uzbeks, Kazan Tatars, etc) Detection project on browser by using tensorflow.js and LeYOLO-v1.

## What is different than [Hyuto](https://github.com/Hyuto) (YOLO TFJS deployment) ?

 - UI with Bootstrap CSS Library
 - UPGRADING YOLOv8 -> LeYOLO (42% less GFLOP than YOLOv9-T)
 - QUANTIZATION (F32 3.61MB -> F16 1.3MB~)
 - Roboflow : Data Preprocessing (labeling)
 - TESTED on Microsoft Windows 11 Pro x64-based-PC 
 - DEPLOYMENT on VERCEL
